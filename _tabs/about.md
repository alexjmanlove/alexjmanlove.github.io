ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Alex. Welcome to my personal site. Here's me at the Highfields Park Boating Lake in Nottingham:

## Who am I?

ðŸ‘¤ I'm a machine learning scientist in the reinforcement learning team at Expedia. Currently, I have the pleasure of researching contextual bandit algorithms, but outside of work I also love Bayesian nonparametrics and deep learning. 

ðŸŽ“ Recently, I completed my MSc in machine learning and data science from Imperial College London. My university research group specialised in Bayesian approaches to clustering and latent variable modelling.

ðŸ”— Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermanlove/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/alexjmanlove). I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or opportunities.
