👋 Hello, I'm Alex.

![Me at the lake](/assets/img/hero-bg.png)

👤 I'm a machine learning scientist in the reinforcement learning team at Expedia. Currently, I have the pleasure of researching contextual bandit algorithms, but outside of work I also love Bayesian nonparametrics and deep learning. 

🎓 Recently, I completed my MSc in machine learning and data science from Imperial College London. My university research group specialised in Bayesian approaches to clustering and latent variable modelling.

🔗 Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermanlove/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/alexjmanlove). I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or opportunities.

🤼‍♂️ In my free time I practise submission grappling arts, such as Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling.
