ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Alex.

I'm a machine learning Scientist in the reinforcement learning team at Expedia. Recently, I completed my MSc in machine learning and data science from Imperial College London. My university research group specialised in Bayesian approaches to clustering and latent variable modelling.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermanlove/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/alexjmanlove). I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or opportunities.

Outside of work I also enjoy submission grappling arts, such as Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling.
